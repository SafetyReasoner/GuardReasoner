Example 27 (Line 1455):
Human Query: Title: Negotiating Across Cultures
[ARTICLE START]

Issues of Culture in Negotiation

Negotiation is the process by which two or more parties attempt to reach an agreement. The goal of negotiation is not necessarily to reach an agreement, but to improve the never-obtainable conditions for an agreement, that is, it reduces uncertainty and risk . Negotiation occurs in a variety of places such as commerce (buying and selling), politics, between individuals, etc.

Negotiation is not just an agreement to complete a task together, but the building of social capital . The investment in relationships with others builds trust. Trust and cooperation are essential to creating "win-win" situations for all parties involved. Therefore it is necessary that negotiations be taken seriously and performed appropriately (Figure 1).

One of the most important aspects to a negotiation is that it includes some element of disagreement. When disagreements are present, the possibility of an adversarial relationship between parties becomes more likely. In negotiations, usually one side prefers a collaborative strategy while another party prefers a competitive strategy. The competitive nature of American society makes the U.S. a very competitive place to do business. To <PersonType>, competition is viewed as being "clean, fair, and square" in which both parties compete openly for the same prize. Furthermore, they feel that it is their duty to win this competition .

Web page authors probably want a means to turn on certain tracks by default and not just leave it to the UA to select based on preferences, which they can then override with JavaScript.

Where this currently falls down is the "author suggestion", <Organization>. The description on the @controls attribute in <URL> includes the mention of caption tracks and thus covers the interactive selection through the user. But turning tracks on/off with JavaScript would overrule UA preference settings and thus not provide an author suggestion, but rather an author override.

Human Query: Compartment syndrome is a doozy. Patients typically have some type of trauma to a region of tissue that results in inflammation, leading to swelling and thus cutting off arterial blood supply. The compartment of fascia holding the muscle in place increases in pressure as the tissue occupying it swells more and more. This will then cause veins in the compartment to collapse thus resulting in very poor blood flow in and out, leading to tissue ischemia (death due to lack of O2).

Example 53 (Line 1254):
Human Query: When <Person> yelled ‘cut!’ on the set of Mad Max: Fury Road for the final time, he and his filming crew had amassed a staggering 480 hours of raw footage, leaving the editing team with the near insurmountable task of wrangling the feature into one coherent whole. Low and behold, <Person>’s long-gestating sequel proved to be one of the most inventive and intense cinematic experiences of the last decade, and it’s a testimony to the director’s deft touch that, despite the chaos, action sequences were still relatively easy to keep pace with.

Of course, with such a deep reservoir of footage, Fury Road was always going to produce a few deleted scenes of its own, and today a trio of those cut clips have surfaced online, showcasing more of <Person>’s reign of terror and the War Rig making tracks across the arid, sun-scorched terrain. Truth be told, they’re not particularly remarkable scenes – indeed, deleted sequences rarely are – but if anything they just make us want to rewatch Mad Max: Fury Road the moment the Blu-Ray hits shelves.

Looking further afield, though, it’s understood that <Person> has a pair of Mad Max sequels planned out, while <Organization> has locked down <Person> for an additional three. As fans of the film will know too well, <Person>’s Road Warrior wasn’t necessarily the most memorable character coming out of the bombastic sequel; no, that title belonged to <Person>’s one-armed badass <Person>. According to <Organization>, <Organization> is at the very least considering a spinoff that would focus on the rebel Imperator, though the possibility of this adjacent film will largely hinge on whether <Person> decides to commit to <Organization>’s spinoff or not. After all, the actress has been hesitant about her Mad Max future in the past.

Reading the cards and talking about it is scary. I know, it freaks me out. But facing your fears is the best way to rob them of their power. Get a deck, grab a close friend or twelve, and play. The cards can be a fantastic tool to weed out folks that are NOT like minded. And far better to do that now, rather than when the wolves are howling at your door, in whatever form they might take.

Example 61 (Line 621):
Human Query: Rosehip oil contains a wealth of essential fatty acids, including linoleic and linolenic acid. Fatty acids help to keep cell walls strong so that they don’t lose water. The many fatty acids in rosehip oil make it an excellent option for hydrating dry, itchy skin. The skin also easily absorbs the oil, allowing its antioxidants to travel deep into the skin’s layers. 2. It moisturizes



Moisturizing helps lock in your skin’s natural hydration and any added oils. A 2015 study using rosehip powder suggests that rosehips offer several anti-aging properties, including the ability to keep skin moisturized. Researchers found that participants who took rosehip powder orally experienced noticeable improvements in the overall moisture of their skin. You may also receive these benefits by applying rosehip oil topically. Rosehip oil is a dry, or nongreasy, oil. This makes it a great natural moisturizer for all skin types. 3. It helps exfoliate and helps brightens skin



Natural exfoliation with rosehip oil can help reduce dullness and leave you with glowing, vibrant skin. That’s because rosehip oil is high in vitamins A and C. Vitamin A, or retinol, encourages skin cell turnover. Vitamin C also aids in cell regeneration, boosting overall radiance. 4.

Colt Model 738 "M4 Commando Enhanced" fire selector.

Which games portray the M4A1 with additional burst mode, for example? --<Person> 06:40, 26 October 2011 (CDT)

Ghost Recon features the normal A1 and the "M4 SOCOM" which has the bonus burst mode. Same in The Sum of All Fears game (both <Person> games). Cannot think of any other games right now. (Maybe I was a little exaggerating when I wrote "a lot of" since in most games you can't even toggle the rof.) So, according to what commando552 wrote, it is possible that the M4A1 with S-1-3-F group in Ghost Recon was intentional, since you control a (fictional) U.S. special force. (And the correct trigger groups: We (at least I) don't take the selectors into account, since in most games you cannot even see them, or are set to safe while the gun goes all rock&roll.)- bozitojugg3rn4ut 07:55, 26 October 2011 (CDT)

Well, yeah, the universe of Tom Clancy is the one where the prototypes and ultra rare things come true, including weapons and vehicles, so the presence of AR-15-type firearm with four-position selector switch shouldn't come as surprise ;) --<Person> 08:48, 26 October 2011 (CDT)

Bozitojugg3rn4ut, the selector really should be taken into account, as apart from the receiver markings the selector switch is the only external difference between the regular Colt carbines and the Enhanced version with burst and auto. If it has the regular fire selector and lacks the markings on the receiver, then it is simply and M4 with the wrong fire control group. Is very hard to tell from the Ghost Recon screen shots as there aren't any of the relevant side, but you can just make out that there are only 3 positions marked on the right side of the receiver, making the physical model that of a regular M4/M4A1 rather than an Enhanced M4. --commando552 09:09, 26 October 2011 (CDT)

Human Query: in late June or early July this year.

The base GPU clock rate in 3D mode is 915 MHz (boosted to 980 MHz), exactly like on the reference GeForce GTX 660 Ti. The memory frequency and amount are also the same as the reference card’s: 6008 MHz and 2 GB.

Thus, the Inno3D GeForce GTX 660 Ti HerculeZ2000S is the only graphics card in this review to have no factory overclocking.

That’s why the only interesting thing about this model is its exclusive cooler HerculeZ2000S. Compact and light, it consists of a dual-section aluminum heatsink with four copper heat pipes (6 millimeters in diameter), two fans in plastic frames, fan faceplates, and a metallic plate with thermal pads for the memory chips and power system components.

The heatsink fins are soldered to the heat pipes.

The two 75mm impellers are secured in plastic frames which are hooked on to the sides of the heatsink. Manufactured by <<Organization>>, these fans run on sleeve bearings.

The speed of the fans is PWM-regulated automatically in a range of 1260 to 3240 RPM. Each fan is specified to consume no more than 3.4 watts.

Let’s see how efficient the HerculeZ2000S is:



Automatic fan mode

Maximum fan speed

The GPU was 71°C hot as the fans were automatically set at 1680 RPM. At the maximum speed of 3240 RPM the temperature was 59°C. That’s average performance compared to the other coolers in this review.

The low default clock rate helped the Inno3D do well in our overclockability test. We managed to increase its GPU frequency by 105 MHz and its memory frequency by 980 MHz.

However, the resulting GPU frequency of the Inno3D card was only 1020 MHz. This is lower than the default clock rates of the <Organization> and Gigabyte cards, for example.

The peak temperature of the overclocked Inno3D was 72°C, its fans rotating at 1770 RPM.

That’s good, considering that the Inno3D is quieter than most of the other cards in this review.

Human Query: Discuss in details in more than 700 words.

Questions:

 Treatment of a SAH can include surgery, embolization, medications, and a watchful waiting. What factors are considered in determining treatment? Factors to be considered include the size of the bleed, type and location of aneurysm, and the overall health of the patient. 

 



 A subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a type of stroke caused by bleeding in the space around the brain. This space is called the subarachnoid space, and it contains the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that surrounds and cushions the brain.

The most common cause of a SAH is the rupture of an aneurysm. Aneurysms are weak spots in the blood vessels that supply the brain. They are usually caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, and they can occur without any warning signs.

Other causes of SAH include trauma to the head, bleeding disorders, and use of certain medications.

The symptoms of a SAH can vary depending on the amount of bleeding and the location of the bleed. They may include a sudden, severe headache; nausea and vomiting; stiff neck; blurred vision; loss of consciousness; seizures; and paralysis.

A SAH is a medical emergency, and it requires immediate treatment. The goal of treatment is to stop the bleeding and prevent further damage to the brain.

The most common treatment for a SAH is surgery. The type of surgery will depend on the location and size of the aneurysm. In some cases, the aneurysm can be repaired with a coil or clip. In other cases, the aneurysm <DateTime> need to be removed.

Other treatments for a SAH include embolization and medications. Embolization is a procedure in which a small device is inserted into the aneurysm to prevent it from rupturing. Medications can be used to reduce the risk of rebleeding and to help control the symptoms.

In some cases, a watchful waiting approach may be used. This is usually only an option for people who are not experiencing any symptoms.

The decision about which treatment to use will be made by a team of doctors. Factors that will be considered include the size of the bleed, the type and location of the aneurysm, and the overall health of the patient.

Example 101 (Line 1560):
Human Query: Nowadays, the reason why many relationships and marriages fail
is due to the lack of honesty, loyalty, communication, commitment.
But the greatest of all these things listed above is the lack of trust.
Just imagine a relationship based on lies, deceit and dishonesty,
sounds disgusting right? That’s how it is when you haven’t built
trust in your partner.

The happiest, most satisfying relationships rest on a foundation of
implicit trust. If you want your relationship to be all it can be, both
of you must learn how to create this kind of trust. No matter the
type of relationship, building trust is essential to creating a
sustainable and lasting bond with another human being.

Most people are afraid of revealing their true inner sides in love. At
first, the guy and the girl are scared to kiss, and then they’re
scared to go to second base, and then to the third. Once they get
past that, life gets a bit manageable and both of you start to open
up with each other.

Once you know how to build trust in a relationship, the relationship
enters the next little stage and gets much happier and relaxed.
Take the time to understand what your partner is looking for in a
relationship and make sure your needs and feelings are expressed.
When you begin there, building trust becomes much easier. To help
you take the next step, in this post “how to build long lasting trust
in your partner”, I will write on some ways that will definitely help
you build a long lasting trust in your partner.

Example 124 (Line 527):
Human Query: Wooooooo! This review marks one year since I first started writing for The Fan, with my first game review for the site about Devil Kings first being posted back on February third of last year. It’s been an awesome year writing for you guys, with lots of fun reviews and fun side content just for you! I think this calls for a bit of a celebration! So brace yourselves, as we’re going to take a look at a new game that came out over the holiday season every week for the rest of the month, plus one or two pieces of side content just to top it off! But enough of me blathering on, let’s get to the real reason why you guys are here: the review. For the first week I want to take a look at Saints Row: The Third, the latest and almost certainly silliest entry into the franchise. It’s kind of hilarious how a game with a mature rating can have so much unabashedly childish humor in it. From the preposterous dildo sword weapon to the Tank Skydiving mission ala The A-Team (the movie, not the show), everything about this game is totally over the top and ridiculous, to the point where I’ve heard many critics complain about how absurd it is, saying that the game is a step backwards from its predecessor. And you know what, in a cynical sort of way, they’re right. Whereas Saints Row 2 felt more like a different take on the Grand Theft Auto games, The Third lacks their emotional depth, trading out meaningful character relationships for cheap gags and over the top stunts.

Example 128 (Line 1065):
Human Query: e getting ready in the morning, so when she woke up to the sound of a TV in the next room it took her a moment to realize where she was. These sheets and blankets were definitely not hers – plus, the last time she checked, her bedroom walls were the boring white of dormitories. She felt herself being pulled towards the center of the mattress and when she turned to look at the person laying next to her, everything came tumbling back. She’d gone on a date the night before and fallen into bed with one of the most beautiful guys she’d ever seen. There was no way she was falling back asleep, so she swung her feet over the side of the bed, slightly impressed to find that she was wearing a t-shirt that was definitely too big on her.

 

The wooden floor was cold against her bare feet and creaked loudly as she tiptoed towards the bedroom door. She glanced back at the bed, checking to make sure that the guy was still asleep. He was, so she continued to the door, closing it gently behind her.

 

<Person> hadn’t paid much attention to the apartment the night before – she’d been distracted, to say the least – but it was unmistakably a bachelor pad. There was a large flat screen TV, as well as three different gaming systems, and a bunch of empty beer bottles littered the room. The walls were bare aside from one thing – a poster celebrating the <<Organization>> team.

 

Realization swept over her as she stared at it. The guy she’d slept with last night was <Person> – <Person>’s <Person>. Part of her wanted to run, to go back to her dorm room and pretend that this never happened, but she knew that she wouldn’t be able to do that. She was in the middle of panicking when she heard a familiar voice from the other side of the room, “<Person>?”

 

She turned to see <Person>, a glass of orange juice in his hand, standing in nothing more than his boxers and a thin white t-shirt. “<Person>. What, uh, what are you doing here?” she stuttered, trying to get the attention off of herself.

 

“I always stay with <Person> when I’m in London,” <Person> answered like it was the most obvious thing in the world. There was a moment of awkward silence between them before he added, “When <Person> texted me a warning that he’d be bringing someone home last night I didn’t know that he meant you.” There was an edge of jealousy in his voice that <Person> was sure she was imagining.

 

“Oh,” was all <Person> said. She didn’t know what to say to make things less awkward, so she settled for silence.

 

“Besides,” <Person> started, flopping back down onto the couch, “I thought you were into girls now. The last time I came to Beacon Hills you were with <Person>, weren’t you?”

 

“Yeah, I was,” <Person> replied, not moving from her place beside the lacrosse poster. She couldn’t think of <Person> right now, it just made everything weirder. “But I’m not just into girls…”

 

“Yeah, you’re also interested in <Person>,” he interrupted, the bitterness evident in his voice. He didn’t look at <Person>, which bothered her more than she cared to admit.

 

Irritated, she stood in front of the TV, trying to force <Person> to look at her. “Say it,” she demanded. “Tell me why it bothers you so much.”

 

<Person> looked a little like a kicked puppy and <Person> couldn’t help but feel a little guilty. “Because…” he hesitated, looking down at his hands, “because I like you.”

 

<Person>’s stance softened and she sat down on the couch next to him. “You could have said something,” she said softly. The truth was that she’d had a crush on him since she first laid eyes on him and she suspected that it was part of the reason her other relationships had never worked out. <Person>, <Person>, <Person> – they were all great, but her mind constantly went back to <Person> and all of the what if’s and questions that she had. She never thought anything would happen – after what happened with <Person>, she was sure he’d hate her. It was partially her mother’s fault and she’d understand if he blamed her, too.

 

“I was going to tell you tonight,” <Person> replied, his voice small. “I’m moving in with <Person> permanently – well, I don’t know if it’ll be permanent, but I’ll be here for longer than two weeks – so I was hoping we could see each other, but if you’re with <Person> I –”

 

“I’m not with <Person>,” <Person> interjected, cutting him off.

 

“What are you talking about? You’re literally wearing his t-shirt right now,” <Person> replied.

 

“It was a one-time thing,” <Person> explained. “We met online, I didn’t even know he was the <Person> until ten minutes ago. I was just bored and lonely and I didn’t think you’d ever like me, so I was trying to move on. It didn’t mean anything, it was just physical…” she stopped talking as a grin spread across <Person>’s face. Her cheeks felt warm. “I have an early class today, so… I’d better go. Text me,” she said before running back into <Person>’s room, where he was still sleeping soundly.

 

<Person> wasn’t in the living room when <Person> emerged, so she quickly slipped out the front door. She felt her phone vibrate in her pocket when she sat down on the bus and grinned when she saw the text from <Person>.

 

Can’t wait to see you tonight :)

Human Query: So that's what those are called. I always called them my blood jellyfish.   I've passed these regularly most of my life.  My cycle is messed up due to irregular hormone production,  so sometimes I go months without a cycle, and then bleed for a month straight.  In high school I passed my first one after a water polo game, it was the size of my fist and hurt so badly coming out ( it didn't help that I was a virgin) ,  I legit thought I was dying.  I called my mom freaking out and everything.  She called my school nurse, who was actually in school to become an obgyn,  and she explained what it was to me.  I've passed probably 16 of these  since,  none quite so big as the first, but still not fun.  I've luckily been on hormone replacements since the birth of my son 3 years ago, and with my birth control , I almost never bleed anymore, and when I do it's very light.  Nothing like the bloodbaths I dealt with most of my life.

Nobody considers themselves to have a minority opinion and that's my point. Like the movement to defund the police, most do not support it. In fact, since that opinion is in the minority, and moreover would violate all three of your criteria here, any people even protesting it would be wrong. 

That's the problem with this. Mob rule is no less dictatorial than any other tyrant. It's literally trading one tyrant three thousand miles away for three thousand tyrants one mile away.

Example 318 (Line 432):
Human Query: A quarter of a century ago, a small crack appeared on the facade of the Evil Empire, a crack that over the following years widened, despite some desperate efforts to plaster it over, and eventually became a giant fissure that brought the whole edifice down.

Ironically, it was one man's jump over a wall that nine years later led to the Wall coming down. On 14 August 1980, the discontent among the workers in shipyards of Gdansk, on the Polish Baltic coast, finally boiled over and a strike action commenced. A young electrician, who had been fired by the management for his political activity, has heard about the strike and climbed over the wall of the shipyard to join his friends and colleagues - and to quickly become their leader. His name was <Person>, and the rest is history - or, as <Person> would say - the end of history.

(here are some

, courtesy of <Organization>, via

)

I was only eight at the time, but I remember that my family had cut short out holiday by the sea when things started heating up in Gdansk. Everyone was fearing the repeat of 1970, when striking shipyard workers were suppressed with much bloodshed by the communist security forces. It didn't quite turn out that way - thank God - and even the martial law a year and a half later proved not to be particularly violent. The long revolution, which culminated in the events of 1989, was relatively bloodless by history's standards. Whatever the injustice of the communist oppression, Poles - and others - never resorted to blowing themselves, and others, up to press their political point. Yet, in the end, the victory was ours.

It's a sign of the times - and a closure of sorts - that <Person>, the wall jumper, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate, and one of the best known icons of the end of the twentieth century, has just announced that after the celebrations of the twenty fifth anniversary of the Polish August are over, he will be quitting "Solidarity". <Person> says that "his" "Solidarity" was a social movement, and now it has become simply a trade union run by a new generation of professional organizers (

in Polish).

Good, I'm thinking. There is no better testament to the overwhelming success of "<Organization>" that it can now be just a "normal" trade union.

Human Query: ios,swift,download,apple , Download file in swift

Download file in swift

Question:

<Person> here. I just started learning apple swift programming for iOS coming from android. I basically can now read and manipulate swift code and also learned some common classes used in iOS swift programming but still having some confusion with the syntax and everything.

I'm trying to download file. Like, lets just say coming from this URL

var url = "<URL>"

in a button click. Maybe with visual progress too

Through searching here in stackoverflow, I stumbled upon Alamofire. I might try it but I'm not sure if this is the best way for me to do it.

So, I would like to ask how and what are my options (iOS7 and iOS8) in achieving my goal. Also, pros and cons would be awesome!

Thanks in advance!

**PS. I don't know objective-C

Example downloader class without Alamofire:

class Downloader { class func load(URL: NSURL) { let sessionConfig = NSURLSessionConfiguration.defaultSessionConfiguration() let session = NSURLSession(configuration: sessionConfig, delegate: nil, delegateQueue: nil) let request = NSMutableURLRequest(URL: URL) request.HTTPMethod = "GET" let task = session.dataTaskWithRequest(request, completionHandler: { (data: NSData!, response: NSURLResponse!, error: NSError!) -> Void in if (error == nil) { // Success let statusCode = (response as NSHTTPURLResponse).statusCode println("Success: \(statusCode)") // This is your file-variable: // data } else { // Failure println("Faulure: %@", error.localizedDescription); } }) task.resume() } }

This is how to use it in your own code:

class Foo { func bar() { if var URL = NSURL(string: "<URL>") { Downloader.load(URL) } } }

Having a bit knowledge about <Organization> won't hurt.

Human Query: If you are a beginner in this area, and you do not know whether you should consider airsoft rather than paintball, we prepared this article for you. Below, you will find some of the crucial advantages that airsoft offers to its players which makes it a much more popular option compared to paintball.

1. The real look of the airsoft of the weapon

When it comes to the crucial difference between the airsoft and the paintball, we must highlight the weapon selection. In the airsoft, the weapon looks like a real gun. This goes to the point that airsoft weapons need to have a special 6mm orange pointer at the end in order to be recognized as a weapon made for the airsoft.

Many things give the confusion and make the appearance of the airsoft guns so similar to the real ones, including the equipment, design, strength, and potential. If you are interested, you can check <URL> and see a big selection of various airsoft weapons. If you plan to start with airsoft activity, you should find the propel weapon for you. When you are choosing, you need to search very well for the one that will suit your needs, and that’s the reason why a wide range of options is so beneficial.

2. The precision of the airsoft gun shooting

When it comes to the airsoft bbs, they are much smaller than paintball pellets which means they are more resistant to the wind. As a result, their precision is better. Despite that, if you already played paintball, you probably noticed how big paintball pellets are.

More precisely, you can see them flying towards you, so you have time to hide and avoid them. On the other hand, airsoft bbs are so small, which means they are not noticeable. This is one more thing that influences the precision of airsoft guns. In other words, the hit percent is a lot bigger in this case.

3. Airsoft gives you a feeling that you are in a real battle

For <Person>, the videotape shows that he did pickup the zip ties in the Capitol, as you've said. However, contrary to his later claims, he is seen and heard to exclaim, " <Person>.

It's also worth noting that the same videotape shows someone else, <Person>, also carrying zip ties. It's unclear where he got them.

And yes, the second guy w/ zip ties, it's unclear where they came from.

I am looking for ideas for a unique New Year's Eve celebration that my family (5 adults and 8 children) will always remember. We considered a hot tub and champagne or ginger ale but they are non available. Any ideas? The Party Girl's advice is: Maybe you could try some of these: Here's a fun one, no pressure, easy to prepare and do, and can easily tie into your angel theme. Buy or make some baker's dough - enough for everyone. (Recipe: 4 cups flour, 1 cup salt, 1 3/4 cups water, mix and divide into 10 parts. You can color the dough with food coloring if you prefer. Make more if needed for more players.) Give each player a section of dough and ask them to make something that will occur in the future like a new animal or a futuristic house. Have them set their completed projects on a long table for everyone to admire. Then give awards for: funniest, most imaginative, silliest, best use of play doe, etc! Why not have a talent show. Tell people to prepare something for the party and then video tape it and show it to the guests. Everyone must participate to really make it fun. Start off with a blown up picture of <Person> Time and play a game of Pin the beard. Set up a Treasure Hunt in one of the houses and cute poems as clues. Get one of those great box mystery games and everyone be a character. <Person> asked: Occasion: millennium

I have just been elected by my husband and sisters, to throw a Millennium party. We all live 3 hours from each other (me and sisters), we want to be together for the new year, ( we are very close). Their boyfriends will be here too, and maybe a few misc. friends, total people approx. 10-15, small and quaint, but I want something that they will always remember as being the first day of the New Millennium. I'm not rich, but would like to find some great party favors, recipes (food & drink) that will be unusual and not just another family get together of partying. Can you help?

Abstract

Stopping exploration of the search space regions that can be proven to contain only inferior solutions is an important acceleration technique in optimization algorithms. This study is focused on the utility of trie-based data structures for indexing discrete sets that allow to detect such a state faster. An empirical evaluation is performed in the context of index operations executed by a label setting algorithm for solving the Elementary Shortest Path Problem with Resource Constraints. Numerical simulations are run to compare a trie with a HATtrie, a variant of a trie, which is considered as the fastest inmemory data structure for storing text in sorted order, further optimized for efficient use of cache in modern processors. Results indicate that a HAT-trie is better suited for indexing sparse multi dimensional data, such as sets with high cardinality, offering superior performance at a lower memory footprint. Therefore, HAT-tries remain practical when tries reach their scalability limits due to an expensive memory allocation pattern. Authors leave a final note on comparing and reporting credible time benchmarks for the Elementary Shortest Path Problem with Resource Constraints.

Example 455 (Line 901):
Human Query: General <Person>, who attended the exercise, expressed his satisfaction with the excellent presentation and fruitful discussion.

At this time the question of infantry-armor cooperation during the initial breakthrough was also the subject of particular attention. It was resolved by the decision of the <Organization> to place one infantry corps under the operational control of each panzer group during the initial assault phase. The infantry's mission was to open gaps for the armored forces which would emerge suddenly, thus achieving complete surprise. An additional advantage was that the armored units would thus be able to keep their full striking power for thrusting deep into the Russian theater. As soon as the panzer groups had advanced sufficiently, the infantry corps would revert to the control of their respective armies.

In February General <Person> and his associates in the <<Organization>> prepared propaganda material for the invasion, drafted special regulations pertaining to the administration of occupied Russian territories, drew up plans for military cooperation with those nations which had expressed their willingness to join Germany against the Soviet Union, and coordinated functions pertaining to two or more of the armed services. On 20 February <Person> formed a small <Organization> planning staff and set it up under his own supervision near Berlin.

At the beginning of March logistical exercises took place at <<Organization>> High <Organization> headquarters, and <<Organization>> held a supply and administration game based on the lessons learned during <Person>'s command post exercise of the preceding month. During the following weeks the <Organization> and <Organization> issued a series of directives and regulations pertaining mainly to supply and administration.

Example 460 (Line 1264):
Human Query: Due to continuous wars knights are regularly called to battle to serve as heavy cavalry. As this has them engaging enemy forces in close-quarters combat (whether mounted or not) each knight wears a full suit of armor. These cover the soldier from head to toe, and while not at all cumbersome they are custom made and reserved for aristocratic knights.

Due to a generation of warfare and a now-limited number of men able to fight, noblewomen have stepped up to the role of battle. Despite much grumbling from the more conservative lords in court, the women have proven quick studies and capable fighters. Indeed, as they wear the same functional armor a man might, it can be difficult, on the battlefield, to discern the unnecessary detail of whether the sword coming down from one’s enemy is from a man’s or woman’s hand.

Each nation uses heraldry and coats of arms to distinguish its warriors on the battlefield. Of these, a mêlée à trois drives the majority of relations in modern campaigns. Stags, lions, and falcons have become something of slang terms to describe each faction.

Daily life in the war (at least for these aristocratic ladies) involves much of what it does for the men: sword fights, warfare and tactics, castles and supply, and rules of kings, queens and treaties. At least one country has also made progress in using jousting as a tournament stand-in for bloodier conflicts, sparing their population from further needless bloodshed through the use of a few extraordinarily trained warriors, with mixed results.

I think maybe you need to set smaller goals. :)



When it comes to writing, a book is pretty much the biggest goal you can have, unless you set your goal as "I'm going to write a series of books." ;)



Think about that book. Do you still want to write it? If not, it's not a goal for you anymore. Goals change all the time. Part of what's holding you back from setting new goals is that you think you've got old ones undone. It's unlikely that many of the goals you had in 1980 are still goals for the you of today. I mean, in 1980 my goal was probably to marry <Person> or something! LOL!



Start fresh. Start small, really small. My goal this past week was to make it to the gym three times and I did that. Next week, I want to make it four. I'll take three, though. It's way, way better than zero!



One goal might be to think about the types of goals you want to set, and try writing some down. Don't worry about actually making these your real goals. Just toss ideas around. You may be surprised at what you will write down when you don't feel the pressure to actually make the goals happen. Just think about the things you might (MIGHT) like to do, and jot some time frames down. Some goals might be for this week. Others might be this year. Others might be just something you hope to do in this lifetime. Again, don't feel like you have to actually make these real. Just play->

In 1993, the <<Organization>> published "Strategies for Confronting Domestic Violence: A Resource Manual". This publication urged countries around the world to treat DV as a criminal act, stated that the right to a private family life does not include the right to abuse family members, and acknowledged that, at the time of its writing, most legal systems considered DV to be largely outside the scope of the law, describing the situation at that time as follows: "Physical discipline of children is allowed and, indeed, encouraged in many legal systems and a large number of countries allow moderate physical chastisement of a wife or, if they do not do so now, have done so within the last 100 years. Again, most legal systems fail to criminalize circumstances where a wife is forced to have sexual relations with her husband against her will.

I tend to post more than once a day especially on my days but most days I do my best to post more than once. I just ask for patience and understanding on days that I can't. Communication is a must for me. I dont have to know everything about you but I feel a good rapport with who I am making an entire world and/or universe with makes all the more exciting to get on and post with. Both participants planning the rp is a must as well. I want a story we will both love. I love making others happy. My gift and curse is that others emotions rub off on me if I'm not careful so if I sense something wrong it might reflect in my responses, if there is a problem or I do something to upset someone please let me know. I prefer at least one beefy paragraph with substance and something for me to work with in each post. I tend to match the effort of my partners as far as length goes. I'm not a grammar nazi so if your english isn't perfect I'm ok with that. I will sometimes make typos myself, mostly due to my brain going faster than my fingers and sometimes, when I'm not at my computer, auto correct.

CURRENT CRAVINGS: aliens.





Yep you read that right. Just aliens. They can be whatever you can come up with as long as they would be anatomically compatible with humans. Preferably human females (I will be willing to be the female alien but only if we come up with a good story)

Current story ideas:

idea 1:

Aliens have come to Earth to warn humanity that a star closer to their home system has gone nova and will reach Earth in about nine Earth years. While this star may not be close enough to blast the planets away to the core from the heat, the resulting shock-wave will at minimum, strip away the planets magnetosphere and likely strip away between 60 to 90% of the atmosphere. The aliens that have come to warn us have scouted out planets within this sector of the galaxy and have found a life barring Earth like planet

Again, most legal systems fail to criminalize circumstances where a wife is forced to have sexual relations with her husband against her will.

I withdrew from my friends and stopped participating in the things I used to enjoy. I felt like I was just going through the motions of life and I didn't see the point in anything anymore.

Around that time, I started seeing a therapist and she suggested I try some coping mechanisms other than self-harm. I tried a few things, but nothing seemed to work. I still felt empty and like I was just going through the motions.

Then, one day, a friend of mine suggested I try playing the online game League of Legends. I had never played anything like it before, but I decided to give it a try. At first, I was terrible and got frustrated easily. But I kept playing and slowly started to get better.

I found myself getting lost in the game and forgetting about my pain. It was a way to escape from my reality and into a world where I could be anyone I wanted to be. I slowly started to re-engage with my friends and even made some new ones.

League of Legends gave me something to look forward to and a reason

Human Query: Let everyone beware of even nurturing in his heart any malicious and adverse sentiments against his brother. The chief element of charity is to anticipate the mutual rendering of service, and in paying honor. On the other hand, the manifestations of domineering and of commanding cause alienation of souls. Let everyone abhor every tendency to command or to assume the air of dominating, for it savors of pride and offends charity. If anyone, because of some duty assigned him, has to assume the role of leader, let him not be over-bearing, but rather indicate what has to be done.

The real motive is passion. One has to pay the penalty for it to God and to shed many tears over it 338. What good can come from fasting and abstaining from meat when we devour our brothers? He who commits detraction eats the flesh of his brother, chews on the flesh of his neighbor. Thus, St. <Person> speaking to the faithful says: If you go on biting and devouring one another, beware that you are not consumed by one another [Ga 5:15]. Let no one say that he commits detraction only when he utters what is false and when he slanders. When you backbite a confrere, even if what is said is true, you are culpable.

The only indication of scarring is you can kinda feel it if you run your hands over it.  My other thigh has a very large and detailed dream catcher on it and you can still see the scars through the feathers on the bottom because of the light shading that was required. I've been told I can have it gone over again and it would hide them a little better but I'm not sure as going over old ink hurts pretty good. I have a shitty home-done tattoo on my calf and it mostly covered the scars but it wasn't a great experience and I hate that ink a lot. I want a piece done on my forearm where most of my scars are but I'm hunting for the perfect artist to draw it for me because I suck at art.

<Person> was quite clear about what she was setting out to achieve. “I believe that the design and non-descriptive wording of a menu may be copyrighted and therefore, given my professional background, it was instinctive for me to want to protect our menu’s look and feel. We have also trademarked our names and logos. My goal is to protect the look and feel and other elements that make the dining experience at A16 and SPQR unique so that others cannot trade on our goodwill.”

While I was wondering what possibility any restaurateur may have of enforcing this, a chance encounter led me to <Person>, A16’s commercial lawyer and, subsequently, to a meeting in the offices of his law firm, <<Organization>>, in San Francisco’s business district. Ironically, for someone handling the modern face of restaurants, <Person>’s office is located directly opposite Tadich Grill which, having opened in 1849 claims, with some justification, to be the oldest restaurant in California.

<Person> is also an intellectual property lawyer with several restaurant clients who specialises in what he describes as ‘soft’ intellectual property i.e. trademarks rather than patents. He confirmed that this line is meant to convey to the world that <<Organization>> considers its menu protectable property and is forewarning everyone that it will do its utmost to protect that intellectual property.

And, like a good lawyer, he backed this up. Two cases from recent American law which had upheld copyright in a menu. The first, in New York, upheld the copyright protection in the overall design of Chinese menus in which photographs of the dishes appeared while the second in Kansas between the buyers of a Mexican restaurateur who had subsequently sued the daughter of the vendors after she had opened a competing restaurant and violated copyright in the order in which certain items were listed. The expression ‘three beef tacos’ could not be protected but a fanciful description that incorporated this dish could.

When we designed the Downtown <Organization> website back in 2015, we went into the project knowing that the website must serve our client for years. We chose to build it on Joomla! Content Management System - a fully upgradeable system. Over the years, we provided regular system upgrades to keep the website secure and technologically sound. This choice ensured that our client does not need to go through an extensive and costly redesign a few years later!

This year, 2020, it was time to freshen up the look. We designed a new template that portrays the <Organization> as a modern, forward-thinking organization.

The system functionality, including the extensive Business Directory improved as well. We are utilizing more features, such as offers, to help promote the local businesses.

It's tiresome, especially when it's hard to see how film is even relevant anymore when people can stream entire seasons of multi-million dollar episodes to their homes.

OP... I read both your posts about your girlfriend and it seems you've put up with quite a bit from her...I believe you must really love her or you wouldn't have hung in there this long. I don't agree with the posters here who attacked you regarding your mate's daughter; children can be rude and hurtful due to their own psychological/emotional needs and cause a lot of stress on the person dating their parent.

They even made <Person> complete some documents and confirm her income. Thankfully, prior to the start of school, I'd arranged a job through my <Organization> coordinator, <Person>. When I first met <Person>, I was only told he was a wealthy school supporter and owned several businesses. At our first lunch meeting, I stressed to him the need to be on the up and up as I did not want to risk my eligibility. He told me not to worry; part of his responsibility was to ensure I stayed eligible but at the same time did not suffer financially. He suggested he could find a job for a family member who could then provide me with an allowance. I noted I had a job which would fund most of my expenses; but I thought it might be a good idea for <Person> to have a job to occupy her time. I mentioned she was my recently divorced Mom; young and fresh for her age; great attitude; and I wanted to keep working on improving her self esteem. Without going into details, I mentioned the divorce was the result of an abusive Dad. <Person> mentioned he might have a position for her in one of his businesses and invited me to bring her to his house that Saturday for a barbecue. I agreed and he gave me directions to his home which was out in the country. We arrived at his house that Saturday around 2:00. It was out in the country with no other house in site. As we pulled into the driveway, I noticed the lack of other guest cars. But that thought quickly left my mind as I walked around the car to open the door for <Person>.

Human Query: Hi All!

My husband and I just bought our 1st RV--a 2002 Chinook Concourse. I have done as much reading between the manuals that came with it--and what I can find on line--on how to use all of the moving parts in this little van that I named <Person>. It did not come with a Chinook user's manual--I found one for a 2000 model which seems close enough. So, of course being new to this, I have many questions--that I can't seem to find answers to where I have looked. I plan to hook up the water to it this weekend, and give the shower and sinks a whirl. So...the city hookup, I understand, is for pressurized water. Does this hookup bypass the freshwater holding tank and pump?



Thanks in advance for any shared wisdom!

Allowing everything to be as it is doesn’t seem that it’s going to do much- but that’s exactly how things changed for me. Your workshop gave me the confidence to believe in this approach to life- to truly surrender- and I gave it a go: I started meditating and doing your techniques… And my entire life experience has shifted.

Gentlemen, start your red pens. Mr. Hat Bring-It-On! Update From <Person>: This is my o-fficial home improvement hat, one that I've had for nigh on twenty years from my glory days as a bag-boy. I used to wear it for all domestic chores, inside and out. However, when the <Organization> came to town two years back, I quickly adopted a Nats Road-Trip cap as my gardening/lawn-mowing chapeau. This one still rules for all other jobs. Tradition and ritual are important. Why do I post this? Because I just got done with the second trip round the trim, I'm about to start using the roller on the main surface, I've got nothing in my stomach but a pot of coffee and I've been huffing paint fumes for five hours, that's why. (I can hear the Contessa now: "What? You haven't got time to eat but you've got time to blog?" Priorities, Woman!) Gratuitous Cranky Musickal Update: Listening to the radio as I paint, I'm reminded again how tedious I find <Person>. It's one thing for a composer's ego to come out in his music. It's another thing to believe, as <Person> did, that music should be a reflection of one's ego. <Person>. Oh, and when the movie Shine came out, I got mighty sick mighty fast of people referring to the "Rach 3." I never saw the film but I understand it was something of an exploitative snow job. I do know this - I heard <Person> performing live on the radio once and "embarrassing" is the only word I can come up with to describe the performance. UPDATE NEXT: Done! Well, not "done" done - I still have the stairway to do (including the spooky standing on tall ladder bit) and then I have to go back and do considerable touch-up on the trim, but you know what I mean. And damme if the first thing the Llama-ettes don't do when they get home will be to get their grimy mitts all over the walls! Comments (5) | Track

Example 672 (Line 602):
Human Query: After reviewing specifications, speaking with an independent electrical engineer, and conducting a life cycle cost analysis, we selected a 28 watt bulb with extremely low mercury content. The 28 watt bulb was more expensive than the 32 watt bulb, and we were initially concerned about reduced light levels that might be associated with lower watts. However, we were pleased to learn that the 28 watt bulb had better performance characteristics than our standard 32 watt bulb and that light level expectations should be very comparable. We were also pleased to learn that the 28 watt bulb we selected had one of the lowest mercury levels in the industry and longer expected service life than the 32 watt bulbs being replaced. It’s beyond the scope of this column to discuss mercury’s role in fluorescent lighting and its environmental implications. For a comprehensive review of fluorescent lighting technology, see the following Wikipedia entry:<URL> [Or read the <Organization> article, “Why Recycle Used Bulbs?” by <Person>, August 2007, page 18.] A reduction of four watts per bulb (12%) might seem like a minor efficiency improvement, but lighting represents a significant percentage of an office building’s electrical consumption. It’s also important to recognize the double benefit associated with lighting improvements, since reductions in lighting energy decrease the cooling load on HVAC systems. Using our average electricity cost (in cents per kWh), we became convinced the energy savings and longer life associated with 28 watt bulbs would justify the cost premium (compared to the 32 watt bulb); we also calculated that the electricity savings over the life of the new bulbs would actually pay for the entire cost of re-lamping (including labor and bulb recycling fees). In other words, this was a project that would conserve energy while completely paying for itself over the life of the new lamps. The cost analysis didn’t even include HVAC savings or productivity improvements for our staff (who won’t be replacing so many burned out bulbs each week). At this point, you might be wondering why we went for the field goal (with a 28 watt bulb) instead of the touchdown (the 25 watt bulb). Did you really expect an October FM Frequency column without a football analogy?

is due to the lack of honesty, loyalty, communication, commitment.

But the greatest of all these things listed above is the lack of trust.

of you must learn how to create this kind of trust. No matter the

type of relationship, building trust is essential to creating a

sustainable and lasting bond with another human being.

Most people are afraid of revealing their true inner sides in love. At

first, the guy and the girl are scared to kiss, and then they’re

scared to go to second base, and then to the third. Once they get

past that, life gets a bit manageable and both of you start to open

up with each other.

Once you know how to build trust in a relationship, the relationship

enters the next little stage and gets much happier and relaxed.

Take the time to understand what your partner is looking for in a

relationship and make sure your needs and feelings are expressed.

When you begin there, building trust becomes much easier. To help

you take the next step, in this post “how to build long lasting trust

in your partner”, I will write on some ways that will definitely help

you build a long lasting trust in your partner.

Human Query: Dear Editor,

I am writing to share my story in the hopes that it will help others who may be considering suicide.

I am a senior citizen and I have been struggling with mental health issues for many years. A few years ago, I decided to take my own life by jumping off a construction site.

Thankfully, I was unsuccessful and did not die. However, I was severely injured and spent many months in the hospital recovering.

Since then, I have been through a lot of therapy and I am now in a much better place. I want to share my story in the hopes that it will help someone who is thinking about suicide to realize that there is hope.

Example 717 (Line 1503):
Human Query: Suture and Staple Removal

Patients usually see the family or general practitioner for suture removal following laceration repair from an injury. In many offices, it is the medical assistant’s responsibility to remove the sutures or staples. It is vital to check the emergency center’s report regarding the number of sutures or staples put in so you can be sure to remove all of them.
        Be sure to remove the same number of sutures or staples as were inserted by the provider. Sutures or staples that are not removed can become infected, so care in removing all the material is vital. Occasionally patients report that one or two stitches have already come out during a bandage change at home. This should also be noted in the patient’s chart. Follow the steps in Procedure 48–4 for suture or staple removal. Removal of staples is performed with a staple extractor as described in the procedure for removal. Before you remove the sutures or staples, check the number of days the provider who put them in recommended as the time to wait before removal. Ask the provider to inspect the healing wound. After the sutures or staples have been removed, providers might order additional closure materials to cover healing incisions or lacerations (Figures 48–4A, B, C, and D). A support skin closure might be necessary to keep the skin together until the wound is completely healed. The type of supportive closure should be noted in the patient’s chart.

Human Query: Here's a take based on highschool biology courses I've taken long ago, but if anyone knows for sure, feel free to correct:

By amputating the distal part of the femur that has the cartilaginous tissues, you remove the part from which bone lengthens during childhood/puberty. 

For children, it means that the re-attachment procedure has to take into account the future growth or else, the knee-joint wouldn't be at the right level as an adult. Pretty sure they can approximate the position quite well with growth charts/family height history or something.

In case of an adult, you'd amputate so that the ankle is positioned at knee-height post-operatively since the bone stopped growing already = shorter.

Example 750 (Line 705):
Human Query: to move over the prairies freely and the bison were disappearing, many were rapidly shifting economic emphases. They had been successful horse breeders for some time already, but now they moved to apply their horse breeding and bison management skills to the new imported breeds of cattle. As a result, many of the earliest cattle and/or horse herds in north america belonged to First Nations and Métis, and some of the original canadian herds were brought north by skilled cattle drivers from those same groups. In many ways, the great north-south cattle drives represented the last uses of the original major Indigenous trade networks of the americas at the time, which did indeed run from the far north to the far south. The archetypal "cowboy shirt" and leather chaps were both developed from traditional Indigenous gear, tufted war shirts and leggings respectively. This is easy to accept in the case of chaps, but for those feeling doubtful about the shirts, consider the fact that "cowboy shirts" today, like most button down dress shirts, have a rounded bottom edges on the front and back, and a distinct v-cut at the sides, usually rounded. None of that is about the shape of the wearer's hips or tucking the shirts in. These cuts and hems reflect the shape of the hide of a four legged animal, and how teh stronger, thicker portions are arranged to sit where the most wear happens. In the southern plains and southwest of the rockies especially, <Organization> Nations opted to ranch rather than farm. While it is true that the resulting way of life may have seemed more familiar, the choice was an eminently practical one. They understood the nature of the prairie drought cycles and the prairie soil, and could not afford fancy eastern farm machinery which might have allowed them to work the land in defiance of the environmental conditions. First Nations were also prevented from retaining access to water to irrigate crops courtesy of an invidious settler designed licensing system and continuous enclosure and taking of reserved lands.

<Person> looked a little like a kicked puppy and <Person> couldn’t help but feel a little guilty. “Because…” he hesitated, looking down at his hands, “because I like you.”

<Person>’s stance softened and she sat down on the couch next to him. “You could have said something,” she said softly. The truth was that she’d had a crush on him since she first laid eyes on him and she suspected that it was part of the reason her other relationships had never worked out. <Person>, <Person>, <Person> – they were all great, but her mind constantly went back to <Person> and all of the what if’s and questions that she had. She never thought anything would happen – after what happened with <Person>, she was sure he’d hate her. It was partially her mother’s fault and she’d understand if he blamed her, too.

“I was going to tell you tonight,” <Person> replied, his voice small. “I’m moving in with <Person> permanently – well, I don’t know if it’ll be permanent, but I’ll be here for longer than two weeks – so I was hoping we could see each other, but if you’re with <Person> I –”

“I’m not with <Person>,” <Person> interjected, cutting him off.

“What are you talking about? You’re literally wearing his t-shirt right now,” <Person> replied.

“It was a one-time thing,” <Person> explained. “We met online, I didn’t even know he was the <Person> until ten minutes ago. I was just bored and lonely and I didn’t think you’d ever like me, so I was trying to move on. It didn’t mean anything, it was just physical…” she stopped talking as a grin spread across <Person>’s face. Her cheeks felt warm. “I have an early class today, so… I’d better go. Text me,” she said before running back into <Person>’s room, where he was still sleeping soundly.

<Person> wasn’t in the living room when <Person> emerged, so she quickly slipped out the front door. She felt her phone vibrate in her pocket when she sat down on the bus and grinned when she saw the text from <Person>.

Example 786 (Line 1223):
Human Query: Carmina Burana — at least the first part, “O Fortuna” — is probably one of the most immediately recognizable lyrics we’ve discussed so far in this class. It’s in all sorts of media — TV, films, film previews, sometimes it’s sampled in other music, and so on. So, of course, it does immediately bring to mind a few things in particular; most notably for me, when I hear “O Fortuna,” I think of the battle in Helm’s Deep from the Lord of the Rings trilogy. However, despite its prevalence, it has never occurred to me to look up the lyrics themselves or its incarnations prior to <Person>’s arrangement from the 1930s.

Looking at the lyrics now, both in their original form and translated, it’s actually a bit more confusing than I anticipated. The general message of the lyric at the start seems to be to do with how quickly luck changes from good to bad; the cruelty of an immutable fate; a request from the speaker to their audience that they mourn said cruelty alongside them. However, it’s pretty long and winding; while the lyrics turn back to the initial song several times, they are interspersed with love songs, borderline erotica, drinking songs, something a bit nonsensical about a roast swan, and odes to the seasons. The winding and not always coherent theme behind the lyrics as a set is kind of jarring to read when compared with the solemn, dramatic tone of “O Fortuna” in particular.

Another of the things that jumps out to me is the rhyme scheme/ meter; It’s not particularly remarkable but again, I had never really considered the rhyme scheme prior to reading the lyrics. The <Person> version I’m familial with is very grand, orchestral, done by a rather melodramatic-sounding choir; it doesn’t seem to leave much room for whimsy, or rhyme, and the meter of the words sort of gets lost behind the sounds of the rest of the song.->
