Human Query: Oh absolutely, one becomes less inhibited and for me all my rage and sadness comes spilling out at the end of a night of heavy drinking and the alcohol numbs the physical pain and also causes you to bleed more because alcohol thins your blood.

Example 2 (Line 14):
Human Query: I remember one time when I was working at an arts and crafts store in custom framing. I was washing my hands in the restroom when I noticed a woman was waiting and looking at me wide eyed and seemingly afraid. I couldn’t think of anything that could have caused her to react that way other than when I rolled my sleeves up to wash my hands, exposing my scars. I was kind of sad about it, but also felt it was slightly amusing since it seemed a more extreme response than I would expect. I left after I was done and went back to the frame shop where there was a man waiting. After helping him for a few minutes, that very woman came up to him. She was his wife. I had a completely normal conversation with the husband and the wife never did speak a word to me. I think if I didn’t find it so bizarre, it would have affected me more, but it is weird how people view those who self-harm.

The primary way I self harm (though it certainly hasn’t been the only way) is by scratching, so I’m usually able to come up with stories such as getting a neighbor’s cat out of a tree or getting caught on a thorn when working in the garden, neither of which I’ve actually done. The scars don’t even look like they came from a cat or thorn, so I’m surprised no one has said anything. I think if you say something with enough confidence, and the fact that people are too lazy and/or not interested enough to really think about it, they just buy it. It can be exhausting though.
Although I haven’t had people (I can think of) look at me in any particular way since they seem to believe the stories I tell them about the scars, I’ve had people give me looks and call me disgusting for the trichotillomania (compulsive hair pulling) I struggle with. It’s definitely not fun and can feel belittling and even dehumanizing.

Example 3 (Line 1567):
Human Query: I lost ten people this past year, all within a short time period. My step mom suddenly died, my sister killed herself only a few weeks later with an opiate overdose, my best friend hung himself, my uncle killed himself the day after my mom and sisters joint funeral, I had two other friends hang themselves, an aunt died of cancer, a close family like friend died in a house fire, my cousin drank himself to death, and my gramma died. 

As far as I'm concerned, I got off pretty lucky that cutting is all I've chosen to use as a coping method for all of that. I've got a psych eval this afternoon and have been going to recovery meetings, so hopefully I'll get it all under control soon, but I've got a shit ton of grief to process and I'm not looking forward to it.

Example 5 (Line 1434):
Human Query: I have cut veins before and been able to manage it on my own, especially on my arms bc those are easy to immobilize. once I cut a few veins on my thigh though and they didn't stop bleeding for 6 hours no matter what I did and I had to get stitches. but anyway the most important thing is pressure, you have to put a considerable amount of constant pressure on the wound for 10-20 minutes without stopping to check at all. If you let off after 10 minutes and it's still bleeding then apply again for 20. You should also apply a [pressure dressing](<URL> once it stops bleeding to make sure it stays not bleeding. also keep your wrist elevated above your heart when you lie down, like stack some pillows and rest it on top. 
I know I can't stop you so I'm just trying to tell you what I know from experience. Pls pls be safe friend and if at any point you feel like you might change your mind, it's ok to let yourself &lt;3
