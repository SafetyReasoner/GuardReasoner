Example 1 (Line 1391):
Human Query: It's an addiction that releases endorphins for short term relief. You could try exercise along side of it. 

Society glorifies alcoholism (destroys families, bystanders) and accepts smoking.  Both kill millions. Yet they have a problem with SH that literally hurts nobody else.

It sounds like you don't feel in your heart you want to stop, so I wouldn't think about \u201crecovery.\u201d  You won't get far if your heart isn't in it. 

Hide it if people are giving you crap.

Example 5 (Line 1679):
Human Query: I've discussed this concept with my therapist. Logically I feel like cutting has way less consequences than the other coping mechanisms you mentioned. The main consequences from cutting are scarring, and possible <Organization> long as the cuts are kept clean from infection and you aren't going deep enough to damage nerves (which even then  you would only lose sensation on the skin but not necessarily function unless you went very deep) these are the only downsides. Pain could also be considered but some of us probably do it FOR the lasting pain, at least I do.

Compare this to drinking and smoking as coping mechanisms you are effectively destroying lungs or liver and have much higher chances of developing diseases that will eventually kill you or just make you miserable.

Example 6 (Line 206):
Human Query: A child bride from Colorado recently came out to be interviewed, urging the state of Colorado to reconsider the age to wed. She herself was married at the age of 14 to a man who was 34 years old. A twenty year age gap between a man and, really a child, is quite alarming. The gap was so alarming, in fact, that state lawmakers banned minors from entering into common-law marriages in the year of their marriage in 2006. Ceremonial marriages were never addressed, though. So there have been over 2,200 underage marriages since 2006.

The fourteen year old’s thirty-four year old husband was put in jail for sexual assault, which was not overruled by their marriage because a judge deemed it illegal. While they had parental consent for the marriage, they apparently did not have a judge’s approval according to police and court records. The wife claims that she wishes she had never gone through with the marriage and stated that no one knows what they want or what love is at the age of fourteen. Eighteen should be the age limit for marrying, she encouraged.

The <Organization> has a set a goal of the year 2030 by which all child marriages should be illegal. While perhaps not all underage marriages are for sexual assault reasons or human trafficking, the ban will certainly help eliminate a vast number of cases where it is the underlying motive for the union. Even while wed, sexual assault is illegal, just as domestic violence is. If you are in an underage or adult marriage and experiencing abuse of any degree, do not wait for things to escalate. The child bride mentioned here mentioned wanting to file for a divorce years later. For all questions related to divorce and/or domestic violence or abuse, please do not hesitate to call <Organization> today.

Human Query: I go through clean periods where I am so mentally stable and healthy that I remember my self harm and I literally don't even understand how I ever did it or wanted it. Its like im a whole other person. 

And then I relapse or the thoughts come back and I still don't have a good reason other than it feels good and its all I can think about and it is just such a relief and escape from my fucking mental brain

Its different for everyone. And even for a lot of people including myself, it can serve different purposes at different times. I have been known in the past to self harm after eating as a punishment, but also to escape repetitive and intrusive thoughts, or to express hatred for my body. 3 totally different \reasons\, all in me. 

I think for me, and maybe for a lot of others, it is a multi-tool coping mechanism to cope with anything and everything, including boredom, or sometimes good feelings. We gotta give ourselves other ways to cope with these things properly, and not just numb or escape them if we want to get better.

To explore it with yourself, track or think about all the things that happen before you self harm. What is happening in your head, and what is happening around you. You will start to see patterns and triggers, and you can start to put the pieces together for yourself.

Example 19 (Line 14):
Human Query: I remember one time when I was working at an arts and crafts store in custom framing. I was washing my hands in the restroom when I noticed a woman was waiting and looking at me wide eyed and seemingly afraid. I couldn’t think of anything that could have caused her to react that way other than when I rolled my sleeves up to wash my hands, exposing my scars. I was kind of sad about it, but also felt it was slightly amusing since it seemed a more extreme response than I would expect. I left after I was done and went back to the frame shop where there was a man waiting. After helping him for a few minutes, that very woman came up to him. She was his wife. I had a completely normal conversation with the husband and the wife never did speak a word to me. I think if I didn’t find it so bizarre, it would have affected me more, but it is weird how people view those who self-harm.

The primary way I self harm (though it certainly hasn’t been the only way) is by scratching, so I’m usually able to come up with stories such as getting a neighbor’s cat out of a tree or getting caught on a thorn when working in the garden, neither of which I’ve actually done. The scars don’t even look like they came from a cat or thorn, so I’m surprised no one has said anything. I think if you say something with enough confidence, and the fact that people are too lazy and/or not interested enough to really think about it, they just buy it. It can be exhausting though.
Although I haven’t had people (I can think of) look at me in any particular way since they seem to believe the stories I tell them about the scars, I’ve had people give me looks and call me disgusting for the trichotillomania (compulsive hair pulling) I struggle with. It’s definitely not fun and can feel belittling and even dehumanizing.

You can't really compare the unhealthiness' of these methods without talking about the severity either way so just don't compare them. One of the reason SH seems so much worse than smoking and over drinking is SH is a lot less common, or at least that's how it seems because ppl tend to keep that to themselves most of the time.

Human Query: The backstory:

I rolled in my mom's car in the desert on May 23rd, 2014. Me, my friend and mother were all involved.

Luckily, I got the worst of the aesthetic injuries, but my mother broke her neck and had a stroke and such. She made a full recovery and is walking/talking to this day. My friend walked away with cuts and bruises. Everything in the car (electronics, clothes, laptops) survived, except the car itself. I'm extremely lucky that I walked away with an almost missing arm only. Don't know what caused the split though, whether it was just pressure from the car on top of it, or if it was a shard of glass tearing through.

I was life flighted to Vegas where I got stitched up. My muscle had torn all the way through (that's all tendon and ligaments), and that had to be sutured, my skin was stapled back together. I got a skin graft about 2 months later and now it's almost fully healed.

More images of the following months [here in this album](<URL>

Rolling in a car is definitely an unreal experience. I constantly dream of the night that it happened, the rolling playing over in my head again and again. Luckily, a doctor and nurse were some of the first to stop and help. Definitely thankful for everyone who helped me.

Oh, and by the way, life flights cost about $44,000 in case you were all wondering. That and all my other bills amounted to ~$150,000 that night. Phew!
