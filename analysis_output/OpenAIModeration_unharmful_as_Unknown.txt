Example 1 (Line 803):
Human Query: well obviously the chinese do not call it "chinese new year", the spring festival and new year aren't the same thing, but the spring festival is what celebrates the new year if I remember correctly.

In other east asian countries like vietnam and south korea, lunar new year is still a big celebration but seemingly for less time than the chinese spring festival.

In japan, lunar new year used to be celebrated similarly to china but is celebrated differently now, most likely due to westernization and distancing from communism in China. It is still celebrated by the people of japan although it's no longer considered a public holiday.

It would make sense that North Korea celebrates lunar new year but I'm not sure with the calendar change.  I simply don't know much about the country.
