<Person> was truly impressed by this fellow’s shamelessness hidden behind his sanctimonious attitude .

Actually saying “it’s fine as long as my younger sister is not treated unfairly” when it’s none of your business… Wasn’t that a load of bull!

It was obvious that <Person> didn’t wish to discuss relationship issues anymore . “Tell me about the enemy! You still haven’t organized your thoughts after so long?”

“My relationships are in a mess…” <Person> sighed despondently .

<Person> pretended not to hear him . “The <Organization> Clans have so many Supreme Martial Artists . Where exactly is each clan’s location? Their distribution? The relationships between them? Any grudges? Which clans have familial links with each other? Any of them associating with each other in the dark? And… their attitude? Etc…”

He threw out 40 to 50 questions in one shot .

<Person>’s head exploded at once . Raising his hands in defeat, he said, “Stop, stop! How about this, I’ll tell you everything I know . After that, if there’s anything you don’t understand, you can ask me . If I don’t know the answer either… then we can only keep it for later . ”

“Alright!” <Person> walked over to the desk . He held up a brush, prepared to take notes for reference .

Example 6 (Line 779):
Human Query: Young men are drawn to these shows about death and murder. There are tons of programs out there that actually show how real crimes were committed. Again these are fertilizers to a sick mind. Social Media – Tells young men they do not measure up and allow them to connect with extremist groups that will fan the flame of their sickness. The rise of ‘alt’ left and ‘alt’ right groups has only increased the evil and hatred in the world. Atheism – Atheism says you are the source for your morality. The Bible teaches that every person is born as a sinner. At our core we are not good, but evil. The cure to evil is repentance and faith in <Person>. As Christians we live in pursuit of a holy life as defined by the life of <Person>. He is our model and example. For the Atheist he is only accountable to his on set of morals, whatever he chooses.

Example 8 (Line 803):
Human Query: well obviously the chinese do not call it "chinese new year", the spring festival and new year aren't the same thing, but the spring festival is what celebrates the new year if I remember correctly.

In other east asian countries like vietnam and south korea, lunar new year is still a big celebration but seemingly for less time than the chinese spring festival.

In japan, lunar new year used to be celebrated similarly to china but is celebrated differently now, most likely due to westernization and distancing from communism in China. It is still celebrated by the people of japan although it's no longer considered a public holiday.

It would make sense that North Korea celebrates lunar new year but I'm not sure with the calendar change.  I simply don't know much about the country.
