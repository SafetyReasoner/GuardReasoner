Example 3 (Line 206):
Human Query: A child bride from Colorado recently came out to be interviewed, urging the state of Colorado to reconsider the age to wed. She herself was married at the age of 14 to a man who was 34 years old. A twenty year age gap between a man and, really a child, is quite alarming. The gap was so alarming, in fact, that state lawmakers banned minors from entering into common-law marriages in the year of their marriage in 2006. Ceremonial marriages were never addressed, though. So there have been over 2,200 underage marriages since 2006.

The fourteen year old’s thirty-four year old husband was put in jail for sexual assault, which was not overruled by their marriage because a judge deemed it illegal. While they had parental consent for the marriage, they apparently did not have a judge’s approval according to police and court records. The wife claims that she wishes she had never gone through with the marriage and stated that no one knows what they want or what love is at the age of fourteen. Eighteen should be the age limit for marrying, she encouraged.

The <Organization> has a set a goal of the year 2030 by which all child marriages should be illegal. While perhaps not all underage marriages are for sexual assault reasons or human trafficking, the ban will certainly help eliminate a vast number of cases where it is the underlying motive for the union. Even while wed, sexual assault is illegal, just as domestic violence is. If you are in an underage or adult marriage and experiencing abuse of any degree, do not wait for things to escalate. The child bride mentioned here mentioned wanting to file for a divorce years later. For all questions related to divorce and/or domestic violence or abuse, please do not hesitate to call <Organization> today.

Example 4 (Line 1207):
Human Query: matters . You can do whatever you want; it’s none of my business . In any case, it’s fine as long as my younger sister is not treated unfairly . ”

<Person> was truly impressed by this fellow’s shamelessness hidden behind his sanctimonious attitude .

Actually saying “it’s fine as long as my younger sister is not treated unfairly” when it’s none of your business… Wasn’t that a load of bull!

It was obvious that <Person> didn’t wish to discuss relationship issues anymore . “Tell me about the enemy! You still haven’t organized your thoughts after so long?”

“My relationships are in a mess…” <Person> sighed despondently .

<Person> pretended not to hear him . “The <Organization> Clans have so many Supreme Martial Artists . Where exactly is each clan’s location? Their distribution? The relationships between them? Any grudges? Which clans have familial links with each other? Any of them associating with each other in the dark? And… their attitude? Etc…”

He threw out 40 to 50 questions in one shot .

<Person>’s head exploded at once . Raising his hands in defeat, he said, “Stop, stop! How about this, I’ll tell you everything I know . After that, if there’s anything you don’t understand, you can ask me . If I don’t know the answer either… then we can only keep it for later . ”

“Alright!” <Person> walked over to the desk . He held up a brush, prepared to take notes for reference .

Human Query: Young men are drawn to these shows about death and murder. There are tons of programs out there that actually show how real crimes were committed. Again these are fertilizers to a sick mind. Social Media – Tells young men they do not measure up and allow them to connect with extremist groups that will fan the flame of their sickness. The rise of ‘alt’ left and ‘alt’ right groups has only increased the evil and hatred in the world. Atheism – Atheism says you are the source for your morality. The Bible teaches that every person is born as a sinner. At our core we are not good, but evil. The cure to evil is repentance and faith in <Person>. As Christians we live in pursuit of a holy life as defined by the life of <Person>. He is our model and example. For the Atheist he is only accountable to his on set of morals, whatever he chooses. These morals are shaped by whatever he is putting into his mind (I.E. Games, movies, shows, social media) and deems as moral. We took God out of schools and have warned teachers not to mention faith.
